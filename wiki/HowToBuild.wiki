= How to build Skylium =

In a terminal, type:
{{{
svn checkout http://skylium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ skylium
}}}

Ok, you've just downloaded sources into folder named "skylium". Go to this folder and compile:
{{{
cd skylium
make
}}}

Some lines of compilation. You're good! The program is ready to run.
{{{
./skylium
}}}

You can remove compiled files (.o) by typing:
{{{
make clean
}}}
